THIS SOFTWARE NEEDS SETUP FOR IT TO WORK, HERE'S THE INSTRUCTIONS:

for windows 10 and 11:

open powershell as admin
type in "wsl --install"
wait for the thing to install
restart your computer
wait for ubuntu to install
go on the windows app search thing
search ubuntu
open it
bash terminal should be ready
now put framerestarter in the penguin icon that appears at file explorer (i recommend putting at the home/[your username] folder)
then at the bash terminal type "cd path/to/FrameRestarter" (replace this with the directory that leads to the framerestarter folder)
make sure you have ffmpeg and mediainfo installed
for that just type "ffmpeg" and "mediainfo"
the installation command should appear if you don't have it (sudo snap install ffmpeg, for example)
copy + paste it
now do "bash main.sh" (or sudo bash main.sh if you get a permission error)
type your video name (you can just type testvideo.mkv if you want to test the program)
(don't forget to put the video in the framerestarter folder)
you're done
